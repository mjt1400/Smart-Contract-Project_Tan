# Smart Contract Project

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 


## Description

This is a smart contract written in Solidity that implements the require(), assert(), and revert() statements.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program

You can run this code in Remix. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Download the sol file included in this repository. You can also just copy the code the and paste it in a new file in Remix.
After that, you'll need to compile the code. On the left side of the Remix website, click on the  "Solidity Compiler" Tab.
Once you're in the Solidity Compiler Tab, click on the "Compile smartContract.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "HelloWorld" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with the code by going to the "Deployed Contracts" tab and input any number you want. Just make sure that you won't input zero or input a number that will cause the set number to go negative.
